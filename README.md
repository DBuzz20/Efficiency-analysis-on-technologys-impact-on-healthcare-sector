Project for the "Productivity and Efficiency Analysis" course. (Master's degree)

Master degree course in "Business Intelligence and Analytics" (Management engineering's curricula).

## Project's description
The goal of the project was to develop a systematic review on the topic of 'Technology's impact on the healthcare sector' (focusing mainly on the Digital Twins technology), followed by an analytic analysis aimed at strengthening the claims of the literature on such topic, by performing an analysis on the efficiency of tech usage in that field.

The systematic review has been conducted by extracting some relevant papers from renowned scientific databases such as Scopus and Web of Science.
Those articles have then been reviewed and examined, involving also tools from the 'R' enviroment like 'Bibliometrix'.

It then followed the statistical analysis, whose first step was gathering relevant data, describing the studied scenario from databases such as OECD and EUROSTAT.
The efficiency analysis itself has then been pursued using 'R', in particular its packages 'FEAR' and 'Benchmarking', in order to perform 'Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)', 'DEA Bootstrap', 'Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA)' and various other tests and data manipulations/visualizations.

To conclude the study, the claims from the systematic review and the results from the R analysis have been compared and discussed.

## Files
The entire study and its procedures are expressed in detail in the 'Report.pdf' file, that also provides the entire bibliography of the papers examined and an extensive appendix giving further informations about the analysis.
The 'DB_report.xlsx' file contains the database for the statistical investigation in R, done through 'R studio'.
Lastly, the 'Command_file.r' reports all the commands applied to the above DB that made up the efficiency analysis for the topic.
